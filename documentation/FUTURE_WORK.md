//------------------------------------------------
// THIS SECTION IS A COLLECTION OF GENERAL TODOS AND REQUIRED FIXES FOR THE PROJECT
//------------------------------------------------

# TODO
- [ ] Set project path via cmake for input/output directories
- [ ] Add proper include directives in each source/header file to ensure all dependencies are met.
- [ ] Implement unit tests for all classes and methods to ensure correctness and robustness.
- [ ] Compile time pipeline validation via static_cast, by using [simplified custom implementation of std::any](https://medium.com/@sonudgr82013/understanding-type-erasure-idiom-in-c-bca2374956ac) (is it possible, or it is still runtime?)

# FIXME
- [ ] Update all logLifeCycle prints with the proper values
